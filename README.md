# Predicting sample level similarity between mass spectrometry runs

A set of machine learning models have been developed to measure the similarity between a pair of mass spectrometry runs using solely MS1 features as input.

The code is currently in a set of scripts and jupyterlab notebooks that demonstrate both the training procedures and how to use the models.
The documentation for how to use the tool is still under development.
 Feel free to reach out with any questions.

## Dependencies
MS1Connect requires the following:
- Python
- pyopenms
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
